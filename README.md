# Ruff-Ruff

## Ruff-Ruff website it is designed form a group project and 3 people contributed to it.
## Our website goal is to help people who travel with pets (especially puppys/dogs) to make their travels more easy. All  necessary information are included in one webstie. For exsample: In the link Walkers with entering the name of the city (where we at or planing to travel), our website finds the nearest park and gives you the address where you can take your dog for a walk. We left a section named "Sitters" for our future upgrade where we can conect people with sitters/walkers who can take your pet to the park when you are too busy . Also we created a "Sign up" where clients can go and log in to their account and schedule their services that our website is providing.

## Ruff-Ruff website it is created with program languages like HTML and JavaScript. Building this website we used CSS framework named Materialize, and also side API like Map Quest and Geoapify. Saying that with HTML was created the structure on the webside and modified with Materialize. Logic part was created with JavaScript where we used side API keys who helped us with fetching the information to finding the city and park locations.

## Our website is designed to be viwed on different screen sizes and its mobile screen friendly.

## Ruff-Ruff in the feature will be updated with new helpfull  features and services like dog groomers, trainers ,pet shops, events and many more other usefull informations.
